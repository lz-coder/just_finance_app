# just_finance_app

Simple application to control your finances.
It's a personal project that I built with the intention of learning Flutter and Dart, in fact it's the first application I've developed in Flutter.
Feel free to contribute.

The database used is sqlite with the help of [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) package.
Package used for charts is [fl_chart](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart).
